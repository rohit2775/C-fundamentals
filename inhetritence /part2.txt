   What is Single Inheritance?

Single inheritance means when one child class (derived class) inherits from only one parent class (base class).
It allows the child class to reuse the properties and methods of the parent class without rewriting them.

ðŸ‘‰ Example idea:

Vehicle is the parent class (it has general properties like wheels, engine).
Car is the child class that inherits from Vehicle and adds its own features (like air conditioning).

ðŸ”¹ Code Example (C++)
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class (Parent)
class Vehicle {
public:
    void start() {
        cout << "Vehicle is starting..." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class (Child)
class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    void feature() {
        cout << "Car has Air Conditioning." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;

    // Inherited function from Vehicle
    myCar.start();

    // Function from Car class
    myCar.feature();

    return 0;
}

ðŸ”¹ Output:
Vehicle is starting...
Car has Air Conditioning.

ðŸ”¹ Real-world analogy:

Itâ€™s like a son inheriting his fatherâ€™s property and also adding his own things.
Thatâ€™s single inheritance â†’ inheriting from only one parent.




one more example for better understanding 


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class Student {
public:
    string name;
    int roll;

    void getInfo(string n, int r) {
        name = n;
        roll = r;
    }

    void displayInfo() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
        cout << "Roll: " << roll << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class
class Marks : public Student {
public:
    int score;

    void setScore(int s) {
        score = s;
    }

    void displayScore() {
        cout << "Score: " << score << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Marks m1;

    // Using base class function
    m1.getInfo("Rohit", 101);
    m1.displayInfo();

    // Using derived class function
    m1.setScore(95);
    m1.displayScore();

    return 0;
}


here 

Student = parent class (common info like name, roll).

Marks = child class (extra info like score).

Marks inherits everything from Student, so it can use both parent functions and its own functions.
