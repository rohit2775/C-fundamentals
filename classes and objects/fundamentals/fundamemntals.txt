Class

A class is a user-defined data type which acts as a blueprint for creating objects.
Jo kaam structure karta tha, wahi kaam class karega.

A class can contain:
Data Members â†’ variables
Member Functions â†’ functions

ğŸ”¹ Object

An object is an instance of a class.
Object ka use karke hum class ke data members aur functions ko access kar sakte hain.

ğŸ”¹ Difference between Structure and Class

Structure
Members are public by default.
Matlab unhe kahin se bhi access kiya jaa sakta hai.

Class
Members are private by default.
Matlab bina access specifier diye unhe kahin se access nahi kiya jaa sakta.

ğŸ‘‰ Short Summary:

Class = Blueprint (private by default).
Object = Real entity created from class.
Structure = Members public by default.
