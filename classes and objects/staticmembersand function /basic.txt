 

 static members in c++ 

 1.static local variable 
 2.static member variables 
 3.static member Functions


 1.static local variables .... 
  ->they are by default initialized to 0 
  ->their lifetime is throughout the program
   we use static keyword to initialze a variable as a static variable 


   lets take an example :;
   
    void fun (){
     static int id;
          int contactno;

    }

    void main (){
        fun();

    }

    int the above example the id is a static local variable and the contactno is the simple variable 
    

  ##    what's the Difference between the state and  simple local variable \
      
      localvariale
      1. it get invoked when the fun function is called
      2. memory consumption takes palce when the fun function is called . 
      3. it will get memory each time whenever the function is called , and destroy the memory allocation after the use .
      4. it is initialized with garbage values 

     state variables 
     1. it is invoked when the program  is executed 
     2. memory consumption  takes place  when the program start executing  
     3. it gets memory at the begining  only once and get destroyed after the program executed successfully .
