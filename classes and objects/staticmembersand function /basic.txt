 

 static members in c++ 

 1.static local variable 
 2.static member variables 
 3.static member Functions


#### 1.static local variables .... 
  ->they are by default initialized to 0 
  ->their lifetime is throughout the program
   we use static keyword to initialze a variable as a static variable 


   lets take an example :;
   
    void fun (){
     static int id;
          int contactno;

    }

    void main (){
        fun();

    }

    int the above example the id is a static local variable and the contactno is the simple variable 
    

  ##    what's the Difference between the static and  simple local variable \
      
      localvariale
      1. it get invoked when the fun function is called
      2. memory consumption takes palce when the fun function is called . 
      3. it will get memory each time whenever the function is called , and destroy the memory allocation after the use .
      4. it is initialized with garbage values 

     static variables 
     1. it is invoked when the program  is executed 
     2. memory consumption  takes place  when the program start executing  
     3. it gets memory at the begining  only once and get destroyed after the program executed successfully .













#### 2.static member variable 
   1.declared inside the class body 
   2.also known as the class member variable 
   3.static member variables doesnot belong to any object , it belongs to the whole class ;
   4. there will be only one copy of the static member variable for the whole class 
   5.any object can use the same copy of the class variable 
   6.they also can be used with the class name .
   7.we have to define the srtatic outside the class .
       data_type classname:: variable name 


    example code :
    
      class men {
        private :
          int regno;
          static int id ;   // declaration of static member variable 

      
      };
       int men::id;
       or 
       int men::id=32;      // definitiion of static member variables 


      void main(){
        men m1,m2;
      }
       

       in this program there will be only one id ; if there will be  n no of objects , then also we have only one id for the whole progtam 
         if there will be no objects the we have also a id 

         

  3 . static member function
   (how to access the static member variables of a class through a static mmember function )

    #1 make a function with static keyword 


    #include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Account
{
private:
    int balance;                  // Instance Member variable
    static float roi;             // Static Member variable / Class Variable

public:
    void setBalance(int b)
    {
        balance = b;
    }

    static void setRoi(float r)   // Static Member Function
    {
        roi = r;
    }
};

// Definition of static member outside the class
float Account::roi = 3.5f;

int main()
{
    Account a1, a2;

    // Static function can be called using object
    a1.setRoi(4.5f);

    // Or using class name directly
    Account::setRoi(4.5f);

    return 0;
}
