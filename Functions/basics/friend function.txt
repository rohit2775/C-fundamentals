Key Points:

Access

A friend function can access private and protected members of a class if it is declared as a friend.
It cannot directly access members without an object.

Caller Object
A friend function has no caller object
It is not invoked using objectName.functionName(), but simply by calling the function.

Membership
It is not a member function of the class.
It should not be defined with the membership label (className::).

Declaration
It is declared inside the class using the friend keyword.

Definition
It must be defined outside the class.

Example:

class A {
    int x;
public:
    A() : x(10) {}
    friend void show(A obj);  // Declaration
};

void show(A obj) {           // Definition outside the class
    cout << obj.x;
}


Important Rule

A friend function is not a part of the class, but it has special permission to access private/protected data of that class.
